DISCLAIMER: Mach8 beta versions are never finished, and therefore cannot be expected to function as intended regardless of the changes made from the previous release.


Beta 1.2 Change Log:

 - Improved overall organization within the files
 - Changed almost all function names for simplicity (mh8_ prefix was removed)
 - Optimized deltaX and deltaY functions for faster compile times and decreased file size
 - DriveStraight function was renamed to driveStraight
 - Added additional math functions -> toRadians & toDegrees
 - Removed unnecessary code for config.h defined motors (Wasn't usable without expert config enabled)


Do do list before release 1.2:

 - Gps driving using trigonometric functions
 - All-inclusive namespace for easier importing/setup for new users


[DEPRECATED] Beta 1.1 Change Log:

 - Changed motor names to L1, L2, etc. for easier 6 motor drive modification
